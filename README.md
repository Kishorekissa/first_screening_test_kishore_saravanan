## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Figma** ‚Äì for creating web and mobile mockups  
- **Google Fonts** ‚Äì for integrating the Manrope font  
- **Feather Icons / Heroicons** ‚Äì open-source icon libraries  
- **GitHub** ‚Äì for version control and project delivery  

üß© Design Process
1. Understanding the Task
I carefully reviewed the three provided sections to identify:

Layout structure

Typography and font usage (Manrope)

Spacing, hierarchy, and visual style

Key responsive behavior and visual consistency

2. Tools Chosen
Figma: For wireframing and high-fidelity designs

Google Fonts: Integrated the 'Manrope' font

Open-source icon libraries: Used consistent and scalable icons

GitHub: For version control and project delivery

3. Frame Setup
Created individual frames in Figma with dimensions 1920 x 1080 px for each section

Set up corresponding mobile frames based on popular breakpoints (e.g., 375px width for iPhone)

4. Design Implementation
Recreated all 3 sections pixel-perfect based on reference images

Focused on clean spacing, alignment, and typography

Ensured design follows modern UX best practices:

Clear CTA hierarchy

Logical content flow

Visual grouping of related elements

Used a consistent color scheme, shadows, and button styles

5. Mobile Responsiveness
Redesigned all sections to fit small screens

Ensured buttons are touch-friendly and text is readable

Collapsed navigation into a hamburger menu for simplicity

Reorganized layouts vertically for better scroll experience

6. Export and Organization
Exported all screens as PNG files in full resolution

Maintained clean file structure:

Separate files for desktop, mobile, and sections

All assets placed in a folder named
First Screening Test - Kishore Saravanan

7. Version Control
Set up a public GitHub repository to host the project

Included a detailed README.md to explain the work

Shared both the Figma link and GitHub repo for review
